# GoLinUCRL: Fighting Boredom in Recommender Systems with Graph and Reinforcement Learning

Implementation of an algorithm exploiting informations of a graph of users to learn faster recommendation policies in the LinUCRL framework. 

This work is an extension of "Fighting Boredom in Recommender Systems with Linear Reinforcement Learning", Romain WARLOP, Alessandro Lazaric, Jérémie Mary, 2018. I was provided UCRL and LinUCRL implementations (UCRL.py file) by Romain Warlop. My implementation can be found in GoLinUCRL.py, and corresponding experiments can be found in Exp.py. I took inspiration from the paper "Gang of Bandits", Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Giovanni Zappella, 2013. More details about the approach and the results obtained are given in Report.pdf.
