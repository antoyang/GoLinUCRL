# GoLinUCRL: Fighting Boredom in Recommender Systems with Graph and Reinforcement Learning

Implementation of an algorithm exploiting informations of a graph of users to learn faster recommendation policies in the LinUCRL framework. 

I was provided UCRL and LinUCRL implementations (UCRL.py file) by Romain Warlop. My implementation can be found in GoLinUCRL.py, and experiments can be found in Exp.py. More details about the approach and the results obtained are given in Report.pdf.
